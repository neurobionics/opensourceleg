# Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through installing and setting up the opensourceleg library. Whether you're new to Python or an experienced developer, we'll cover everything you need to get started.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install opensourceleg
```

If you're familiar with Python packages, the command above will get you started quickly. However, we recommend reading through the complete guide for a better setup.

## Understanding Installation Methods

We offer two ways to install opensourceleg:

- **Standard Installation**: For users who want to use the library as-is
- **Development Installation**: For contributors or users who need to modify the library

### 1. Standard Installation (Recommended for Most Users)

#### Prerequisites Explained

- **Python 3.11 or newer**: The library requires modern Python features. [Download Python here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  > ðŸ’¡ When installing Python, make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" on Windows!
- **pip**: Python's package installer (comes with Python)
  > ðŸ’¡ To verify your installation, open a terminal and run:
  >
  > ```bash
  > python --version
  > pip --version
  > ```

#### Virtual Environment Setup

A virtual environment helps avoid conflicts between different projects and their dependencies. It is generally a good idea to use one.

```bash
# Step 1: Create a virtual environment
# This creates a new folder named .venv with a fresh Python installation
python -m venv .venv

# Step 2: Activate the virtual environment
# On Linux/macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate

# You'll know it's working when you see (.venv) at the start of your terminal line

# Step 3: Install opensourceleg
pip install opensourceleg
```
#### Hardware-Specific Dependencies

The opensourceleg library supports a variety of actuators and sensors, each with its own dependencies. Rather than installing all possible dependencies (which can be extensive), we recommend installing only what you need for your specific hardware configuration.

### Installing Hardware-Specific Packages

You can easily install hardware-specific dependencies using pip's "extras" feature:

```bash
# For Dephy actuators
pip install opensourceleg[dephy]

# For Moteus actuators
pip install opensourceleg[moteus]

# For I2C communication
pip install opensourceleg[communication]

# For gRPC messaging functionality
pip install opensourceleg[messaging]
```

### Available Extras

| Extra | Dependencies |
|-------|-------------|
| `dephy` | flexsea |
| `moteus` | moteus, moteus-pi3hat |
| `communication` | smbus2 |
| `messaging` | grpcio, grpcio-tools, types-protobuf |

This approach keeps your installation lightweight and focused on just the hardware you're working with.


ðŸ’¡ **Why Use a Virtual Environment?**
Keeps your projects isolated

- Prevents version conflicts
- Makes it easier to share your project
- Allows different Python versions for different projects

#### Basic Usage Example

```python
# Import the components you need
from opensourceleg.actuators.dephy import DephyActuator
from opensourceleg.sensors.encoder import AS5048B

# Now you can use these components in your code
...
```

### 2. Development Installation

This section is for those who want to contribute to opensourceleg or need to modify its code.

#### Prerequisites in Detail

- **Python 3.11+**: Same as above (we support Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13)
- **UV**: A fast Python package manager. The easiest way to install UV is via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```
   For other installation methods (including standalone installers), see the [UV installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

- **Git**: Version control system, see [Git installation guide](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

#### Detailed Development Setup

1. **Fork & Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   # First, fork the repository on GitHub (click the 'Fork' button)

   # Then clone your fork (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username)
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/opensourceleg.git

   # Move into the project directory
   cd opensourceleg
   ```

2. **Configure Development Environment**

   ```bash
   # Connect your fork to the main repository for updates
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/neurobionics/opensourceleg.git

   # Create and activate a virtual environment with UV
   uv venv

   # Activate the virtual environment
   # On Linux/macOS:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows:
   .venv\Scripts\activate

   # Install project dependencies using UV
   uv sync  # Installs all dependencies including hardware-specific packages

   # Install pre-commit hooks and setup development tools
   make install
   ```

   > **Windows Users**: You'll need to install `make` first: Install [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) and run: `choco install make`. Alternatively, download from [GnuWin32](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)

3. **Development Workflow Guide**

   ```bash
   # Create a new branch for your changes
   git checkout -b feature-name
   # Use a descriptive name like 'add-new-sensor' or 'fix-motor-bug'

   # After making changes, run the quality checks
   make check    # Runs linting, type checking, and dependency validation
   make test     # Runs the full test suite with coverage

   # Run documentation locally to preview changes
   make docs     # Serves documentation at http://localhost:8000

   # Commit your changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Detailed description of your changes"
   git push origin feature-name
   ```

4. **UV Development Commands**

   UV makes development much faster and more reliable:

   ```bash
   # Add a new dependency
   uv add package-name

   # Add a development dependency
   uv add --group dev package-name

   # Run commands in the project environment
   uv run python script.py
   uv run pytest tests/
   uv run mypy opensourceleg/

   # Check your environment
   uv pip list              # See installed packages
   uv python list           # See available Python versions
   ```

5. **Contributing to opensourceleg**
   If you want to contribute your modifications to the `opensourceleg` library so that others can use them, please read our [contribution guidelines](contributing.md).

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. System Package Warnings

If you see warnings about breaking system packages (common in Python 3.11+):

```bash
# Not recommended, but works if you're in a hurry:
pip install opensourceleg --break-system-packages

# Better solution: Use a virtual environment as described above
```

### 2. Virtual Environment Problems

If your virtual environment isn't activating:

```bash
# Check where Python is running from
which python  # on Unix/macOS
where python  # on Windows

# Should show path to your virtual environment
# Example: .venv/bin/python
```

### 3. UV Installation Issues

If UV isn't working:

```bash
# Verify UV installation
uv --version

# Check if UV is in your PATH
which uv  # on Unix/macOS
where uv  # on Windows

# If not found, try adding to PATH or reinstalling
```

### 4. Development Environment Issues

If you encounter issues with the development setup:

```bash
# Clean and reinstall everything
rm -rf .venv uv.lock
uv sync

# Verify development tools are working
uv run pre-commit --version
uv run pytest --version
uv run mypy --version
```

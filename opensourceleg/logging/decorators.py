"""
Module providing decorators to mark functions as deprecated.

This module contains three decorators that can be used to mark functions as deprecated,
optionally providing a suggested alternative or automatically routing calls to an alternative
function. When a deprecated function is called, a warning is logged using the Logger from
opensourceleg.logging.

Decorators:
    deprecated: Marks a function as deprecated.
    deprecated_with_suggestion: Marks a function as deprecated and suggests an alternative.
    deprecated_with_routing: Marks a function as deprecated and routes calls to an alternative function.
